## Build Journey Writing Rules

When the task is to create or revise Build Journey posts, do this first:

1. Read `BUILD_JOURNEY_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
2. Use `BUILD_JOURNEY_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` if raw notes are incomplete or scattered

Then follow those rules strictly for tone, wording, structure, and multilingual output.
