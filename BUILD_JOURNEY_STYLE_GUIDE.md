# Build Journey Style Guide

This guide is the default writing standard for all Build Journey posts.

Goal: keep voice sincere, grounded, and consistent in every language.

## 1) Voice Identity

- Write in first person.
- Speak as one person wearing two hats:
  - `构造者` (builder)
  - `使用者` (user)
- Core stance: I am not observing users from outside. I came from them.
- Build with users, not above users.

## 2) Tone Principles

- Sincere, specific, and calm.
- Share real experience, not abstract preaching.
- Use reflection, not superiority.
- Keep it restrained: no hype, no performance, no forced drama.
- Keep design alive: this is an ongoing exploration, not a final doctrine.

## 3) Language and Wording Rules

### Preferred framing

- “我遇到了什么 -> 我怎么处理 -> 我学到了什么”
- “同一个我，在不同帽子下看见不同问题”
- “这是视角差异，不是立场对立”

### Avoid these patterns

- Rhetorical interrogation:
  - Avoid: “你有没有这种感觉？”
  - Prefer: “我最近反复遇到这个场景。”
- Sales-like persuasion:
  - Avoid: “你是否也在经历…”
  - Prefer: “我自己在这个环节卡住了。”
- Identity distance / intellectual hierarchy:
  - Avoid self-positioning as “engineer vs users”.
  - Prefer “构造者视角 / 使用者视角”.
- Excessively negative labels as headline tone:
  - Avoid naming sections with annoyance-first phrasing.
  - Prefer neutral, constructive framing.

### Naming conventions

- Chinese:
  - Use `使用者` and `构造者`.
  - Avoid `工程师 vs 用户` confrontation narrative.
- English:
  - Prefer `builder` / `people` / `users` as context requires.
  - Do not build superiority framing around “engineer mindset”.
- Japanese:
  - Prefer `作り手` / `使い手`.
  - Avoid superiority framing with `エンジニア vs ユーザー`.

### Technical terms

- Keep technical terms in English when translation hurts precision.
- Example: `activation flow`, `sequencing`, `processing pipeline`, `high fidelity`.

## 4) Recommended Post Structure

Use this order unless there is a strong reason not to:

1. Real moment
   - One concrete scene from real usage.
2. Perspective split in one self
   - What changed between builder mode and user mode.
3. What I changed
   - Key design or implementation decisions.
4. Tradeoff and reasoning
   - Why this choice, what was sacrificed.
5. Outcome in use
   - What actually got smoother or clearer.
6. Open reflection
   - What is still unresolved and worth exploring.

## 5) Multilingual Workflow

1. Write Chinese first (`zh`).
2. Produce English (`en`):
   - either faithful translation or idiomatic rewrite
   - preserve emotion and intent, not literal word order
3. Produce Japanese (`ja`):
   - natural Japanese cadence
   - preserve humility and first-person sharing
4. Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`) must stay synchronized.
   - If project uses automatic conversion, verify key terms and tone.

## 6) Quality Checklist (Pre-Publish)

Before shipping, confirm all answers are “yes”:

1. Is this written as personal sharing instead of interviewing the reader?
2. Is there at least one concrete real-life moment?
3. Is “构造者/使用者” perspective clear without creating opposition?
4. Did we avoid self-labeling as “engineer” in a superior frame?
5. Is the tone sincere and restrained (not hype, not sales)?
6. Are key tradeoffs and decisions concrete?
7. Does the ending leave room for ongoing iteration?
8. Are English and Japanese natural, not machine-literal?
9. Is zh-TW synchronized (or conversion path verified)?

## 7) Quick Rewrite Examples

- Question-led -> Share-led
  - Before: “你有没有遇到过这种情况？”
  - After: “我这周又遇到了这个情况。”

- Opposition -> Dual-hat
  - Before: “工程师关注流程，用户关注结果。”
  - After: “我戴构造者帽子时关注流程，戴使用者帽子时只关心结果。”

- Feature pitch -> Experience insight
  - Before: “这个功能可以显著提升效率。”
  - After: “我把这个步骤放到后台后，终于能直接进入创作。”
